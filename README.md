# covid-19-simulation
This project aims to simulate the spread of covid-19 under different circumstances. 
We build a virus simulator in order to demonstrate how virus will spread widely without further
protection, and how effective each measure of protection is to stop the spread, including
social distancing, quarantine, masks and hand sanitization.

This project must be implemented in GreenFoot IDE to see the GUI.
